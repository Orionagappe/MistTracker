## **What Does Mist Solution Do?**

- **Tracks and visualizes items, characters, and events** across time, space, and other dimensions, supporting both 3D and nD (higher-dimensional) navigation and projection.
- **Supports advanced navigation and projection** using metric tensors, wave functions, and physics-based logic for realistic rendering, lighting, and sound.
- **Enables collaborative, real-time exploration** of complex worlds or datasets, with secure peer-to-peer (P2P) networking, session management, and moderation.
- **Provides physically-based rendering and audio**, using wave and metric tensor logic for realism and scientific accuracy.
- **Is modular and extensible:**  
  - **MistTrackerVulkan.js** is the core engine for data, state, and logic.
  - **MistIllum.js** adds advanced UI, rendering, audio, and physics.
  - **MistMulti.js** enables multi-user, P2P, and real-time collaboration.
  - **pureMathPhysicsEngine.js** provides the mathematical and physics foundation for all metric, wave, and probability logic.

## **Key Features**

- **High-dimensional data modeling:** Track and relate items, categories, and events in 3D, 4D, or higher spaces.
- **Advanced rendering:** Physically-based lighting, global illumination, and world warping using wave and metric tensor logic.
- **Audio and soundscape:** Wave-based audio modulation, spatial sound, and interaction-aware volume.
- **Physics engine:** Supports dimensional stacking, energy distribution, and curved/non-flat geometries.
- **Multi-user collaboration:** Real-time P2P sync, event confirmation, anomaly detection, and moderation (including bans and event horizon logic).
- **Customizable UI:** Tiling, multi-monitor support, menu overlays, and user-configurable keybinds.
- **Data integrity and provenance:** All events and changes are tracked with provenance, error-checked, and confirmed by the swarm before being persisted.

## **Typical Use Cases**

- Narrative/world-building tools for writers and game designers.
- Scientific visualization of high-dimensional or temporal data.
- Collaborative story analysis or simulation.
- Educational tools for exploring physics, geometry, or history.
