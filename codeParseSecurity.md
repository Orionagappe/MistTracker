1. Robust Extraction and Decoding
RTF/Document Parsing:
Use a reliable RTF/text parser to extract only the plain text or code, stripping all formatting, control words, and hidden fields.
Hidden Content Detection:
Scan for hidden fields, comments, or embedded objects (e.g., {\\*\\...} in RTF, or <script>, <!-- ... --> in HTML/XML) and decide if/how to process or ignore them.
2. Input Sanitization
Remove or escape dangerous characters (e.g., backticks, quotes, tabs, newlines) that could break your table structure or be used for injection.
Normalize whitespace to avoid accidental merging or splitting of fields.
3. Syntax and Structure Validation
Validate extracted code/data using a language-appropriate parser (AST for code, CSV/TSV parser for tables).
Reject or flag malformed or suspicious content before further processing.
4. Controlled Parsing
Never execute or eval extracted code.
Only analyze and extract structure (e.g., function names, parameters, comments).
Run parsing in a sandboxed or restricted environment if possible, especially for user-supplied files.
5. Schema Enforcement
Define and enforce a strict schema for your relational tables (e.g., type, parameter, arg, file, line).
Validate all extracted data against this schema before inserting into Mist Data sheets.
6. Provenance and Auditing
Record the source file name, path, and timestamp for each parsed entry.
Log all parsing actions and errors for traceability and review.
7. Access Control
Restrict who can upload or trigger parsing to trusted users.
Audit changes to the relational tables for accountability.
8. Incremental and Idempotent Updates
Support incremental parsing (only update changed files/lines) to avoid data loss and improve performance.
Ensure repeated parsing does not create duplicates in your tables.
9. Testing and Review
Test your parser on a variety of files (including those with hidden or malformed content).
Review parsed output for correctness and completeness.
