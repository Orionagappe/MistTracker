### MistIllum Description  MistTrackerVulkan.js

**Purpose:**  
This is the **core logic and data engine** for the MistTracker solution.

* Manages all data structures (lines, items, locations, sessions, etc.).  
* Handles CRUD operations with the database (MySQL).  
* Provides session and state management.  
* Implements advanced navigation, selection, and rendering logic (including nD geometry and projection).  
* Supports integration with X11/Vulkan for high-performance visualization.  
* Exposes all core APIs for use by UI, physics, and multi-user modules.

### MistIllum.js

**Purpose:**  
This is the **client shell and advanced rendering/audio/UI module** for MistTracker.

* Provides tiling, multi-monitor, and overlay support for the viewport.  
* Implements lighting, global illumination, and advanced rendering (e.g., world warping, wireframes, rasterization).  
* Handles audio and soundscape features.  
* Offers settings, menus, and system checks for dependencies.  
* Integrates with MistTrackerVulkan.js (core) and optionally MistMulti.js (multi-user).  
* Contains a physics engine interface and metric tensor logic for nD/3D/4D physics, compatible with the core.

### MistMulti.js

**Purpose:**  
This is the **multi-user, peer-to-peer (P2P), and real-time collaboration module**.

* Manages user sessions, presence, and authentication.  
* Handles host announcement and peer discovery (DHT/torrent-inspired).  
* Implements secure communication (encryption, signing).  
* Provides real-time event handling and state synchronization between users.  
* Ensures rate limiting and user presence tracking.  
* Keeps physics and core state in sync across all peers for collaborative sessions.

### pureMathPhysicsEngine.js **(referenced, not shown in full)**

**Purpose:**  
This is a **theoretical and mathematical foundation** for the physics and metric tensor logic used in MistIllum.js and MistTrackerVulkan.js.

* Provides formulas and tensor structures for relativistic and nD physics.  
* Serves as a reference for implementing metric-based orientation, navigation, rendering, and collision logic.

## **How They Work Together**

* MistTrackerVulkan.js is the core: all data, state, and logic live here.  
* MistIllum.js is the client shell: it provides advanced UI, rendering, audio, and physics, using the core APIs.  
* MistMulti.js is the optional multi-user layer: it enables real-time, P2P collaboration and keeps all clients in sync.  
* pureMathPhysicsEngine.js is the math/physics reference: its concepts are implemented in the physics and metric logic of the other modules.

---

**In summary:**

* **MistTrackerVulkan.js:** Core data and logic engine  
* **MistIllum.js:** Client shell for UI, rendering, audio, and physics  
* **MistMulti.js:** Multi-user, P2P, and real-time collaboration  
* **pureMathPhysicsEngine.js:** Mathematical/physics foundation for metric and physics logic
