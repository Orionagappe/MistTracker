## **Core Components and What They Do**

### **1\.** MistTrackerVulkan.js **(Core Engine)**

* **Purpose:**  
  The heart of the Mist solution. It manages all data structures (lines, items, categories, locations, sessions), handles database operations, and provides APIs for navigation, selection, and advanced rendering.  
* **Features:**  
  * 4D (and nD) item tracking: Items are organized by time, category, and other axes.  
  * Session and state management: Tracks user navigation and opened items.  
  * Advanced geometry: Supports projections, orthogonal navigation, and 3D/4D visualization.  
  * Integration-ready: Designed for use with GPU rendering (Vulkan/X11) and external modules.

### **2\.** MistIllum.js **(Client Shell & Advanced Rendering)**

* **Purpose:**  
  Provides the user interface, advanced rendering (lighting, global illumination, world warping), audio/soundscape, and physics integration.  
* **Features:**  
  * Multi-monitor and tiling support.  
  * Wave-based lighting and sound (using physical wave functions).  
  * Physics engine with metric tensor support for nD/3D/4D space.  
  * Settings, overlays, and system checks for a seamless user experience.  
  * Modular: Can be extended or themed for different applications.

### **3\.** MistMulti.js **(Multi-User, P2P Collaboration)**

* **Purpose:**  
  Enables real-time, peer-to-peer collaboration and state synchronization between multiple users.  
* **Features:**  
  * User session management and presence tracking.  
  * Host announcement and peer discovery (DHT/torrent-inspired).  
  * Secure, encrypted communication and event broadcasting.  
  * Shared state synchronization and conflict resolution.  
  * Rate limiting and moderation tools (e.g., Pit Boss for bans).

### **4\.** pureMathPhysicsEngine.js **(Mathematical/Physics Foundation)**

* **Purpose:**  
  Provides the theoretical and computational basis for all metric, wave, and physics logic in the Mist solution.  
* **Features:**  
  * Metric tensor and relativistic physics formulas.  
  * Wave function and interference logic for both light and sound.  
  * Tools for time dilation, energy distribution, and higher-dimensional geometry.
